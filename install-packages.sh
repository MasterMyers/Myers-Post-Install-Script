#!/bin/bash

# This bash script aims to install all the packages I usually get after reinstalling my System. It's mainly made with EndaevourOS and Ubuntu
# in mind. It might also work with other distros that use pacman or apt. This script does the following tasks:
#   1. Checks if Flatpak is installed and installs it if necessary.
#   2. Checks if pacman is installed and installs yay if necessary.
#   3. Checks if apt is installed.
#   4. Defines package bundles for both pacman and apt.
#   5. Prompts the user for a package bundle choice.
#   6. Installs the selected packages using the appropriate package manager (pacman or apt) and also installs the Flatpak packages if needed.

# Check if Flatpak is installed
if ! command -v flatpak &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Flatpak is not installed. Installing Flatpak..."

    # Check the package manager and install Flatpak accordingly
